# E-commerce Product Listing Page (PLP)

This project is a fully functional Product Listing Page (PLP) created as an assessment for Appscrip. The primary goal was to replicate a provided Figma design, demonstrating skills in React.js, responsive web design, and API integration.

The application fetches product data from the Fake Store API and displays it in a responsive grid. It includes a sidebar for filters (visual only) and is designed to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
